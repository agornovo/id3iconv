	- Bug fix: Under windows, cannot rename the output temp file to the original file name
    - Bug fix: Conversion from v2 tag is using different encoding (big-endian UTF-16) 
      from conversion from v1.  Now both using little-endian UTF-16 for better compatibility.
	- Added option to force using id3v1 tag even if v2 tag exists
	- Added option to remove v1 tag after convertion
